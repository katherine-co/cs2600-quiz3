Lo Shu Magic Square

The Lo Shu Magic Square is a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns.
The Lo Shu Magic Square has the following properties: 
    • The grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly. 
    • The sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal all add up to the same number. 

Create a program by simulating a magic square using a two-dimensional array. Write a 
function that accepts a two-dimensional array as an argument and determines whether the 
array is a Lo Shu Magic Square. Test the function in a program.

    1) Create the program and test with an array that is a Lo Shu Magic Square and test 
    where it is not. The array’s can be defined in your main and should not need to be 
    input from the user.

    2) Create and populate a two-dimensional array with random numbers from 1-9. Recall 
    no number should repeat when populating the array. Then check if it is a Lo Shu 
    Magic Share. Put this random number placement in a loop until you do get a Lo Shu 
    Magic Square. Print two things:
        a. The total number of squares generated and tested before success, the count.
        b. Print the square and show the placement of values in the following format:
            [a b c]
            [d e f]
            [g h i]
