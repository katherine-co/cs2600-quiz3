Number guessing game 

Create an interactive program that allows a user to guess a number between 1-10. You 
should create a menu that will have options (this should be displayed on the screen):
    Press 1 to play a game
    Press 2 to change the max number
    Press 3 to quit
If option 1 is selected the program should prompt the user to enter a number. 
If the user is correct tell them they won then the program should go back to the menu. 
Otherwise tell them if they were too low or high in there guess and allow them to guess 
again. This should continue until they win. If they enter q instead of a number when 
prompted the game should end(NOT the program) and return to the menu.

If option 2 is chosen, then tell them the max value they can set the number. Make sure 
they do not enter a negative number or go above the max value.

If option 3 is chosen thank the user for playing and end the game.

Now create a new branch â€“ call it save_user_max_number
Can you save the users request for the max number where the program is able to 
remember it the next time it starts?
